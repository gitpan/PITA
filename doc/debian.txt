some notes for the next debian install...


256 MB RAM, no swap partition, 1GB disk size


passwords:
- empty root password
- user pita, empty password


install:
- make
- gcc
- perl-modules
- ftp
- libc6-dev
- (svn)
- second perl (5.8.7) -> /opt/pita
- custom perls -> /opt/perl-5.x.x


configuring:
- Tweak sample-launch-script.pl as needed.
- Save to ~root/launch_pita.pl and mark executable
- symlink the launch script to /etc/rc2.d/S99zpita
  (The z makes it run last without having to disturb the other S99 items)


questions:
- configure CPAN? -> yes, both system and pita perl (prerequs: follow)
- Timeouts? Does Module::Install play well with default answers to questions?
